Teddy bear Gosha is a warm and cozy collectible bear from the “Keeper of Time” series.
He stands 39 cm tall and is entirely handmade from German mohair with a dense, soft pile — thick yet gentle to the touch.

Inside lives the spirit of the forest: cedar wood shavings and cedar wool.
His paws and soles are made of mini-shtoff fabric.
The eyes are black glass (Germany) — deep and full of life.
His nose is hand-embroidered and waxed, and his muzzle is gently tinted with oil paints.

Gosha is adorned with a knitted wool scarf and a bronze-tone clock pendant — a symbol of his name and his role as the Keeper of Time.
