The Fedor bear was created according to the Soviet pattern of the 1950s.
13 cm standing. A constant companion in the palm of your hand or will be happy to be placed on a shelf.
• Sewn from German viscose, glass eyes, cedar sawdust and metallic granules — the bear is pleasantly heavy.
• Thick padding — the toy holds its shape well. 
-Accessory: Soviet lace and Soviet ribbon
• Can stand on its own.
