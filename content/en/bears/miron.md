Height: 13 cm.
Made from vintage Soviet velvet, using an original 1950s Soviet pattern.
Filled with cedar shavings and metal granulate.
Glass eyes, sailor-style accessories, gently aged for a soft vintage look.

Miron is calm, thoughtful, and comforting — a quiet companion who simply enjoys being nearby.
Handmade in a single edition.
A collectible teddy bear, not intended as a toy for children.
