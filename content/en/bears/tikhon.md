Teddy bear Tikhon is handmade in the classic style using the “Torture” technique of artificial aging. His surface is deliberately worn, faded, patched, and slightly soiled, creating the authentic look of an “attic” teddy with history. A collectible bear that makes a heartfelt gift, a unique décor accent, and a valuable addition to any teddy collection.
