Classic Teddy bear named Patrick 🐻 — a true embodiment of autumn warmth and timeless charm. Standing 27 cm tall, he is crafted from luxurious German mohair in rare shades of deep black and fiery brown, as if carrying all the colors of autumn within him. This fabric is far too exquisite to be hidden — it was made to shine and bring warmth to the heart.
