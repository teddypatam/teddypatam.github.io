Little Bruno is a classic teddy bear standing 15.5 cm tall, crafted from mohair. Its coat shimmers beautifully thanks to the multidirectional pile, giving the bear a lively and unique look. Inside, Bruno is filled with fragrant cedar sawdust and wool, along with glass and metal granules for a comforting weight. Handmade in the traditional teddy technique, this bear is both a collectible treasure and a heartfelt gift.
