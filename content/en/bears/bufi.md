Buffy the Bear is like a cloud of vanilla marshmallow — soft, warm, with a fluffy coat the color of creamy honey.
His amber eyes shine like tiny sunbeams hidden in golden depths.
Around his neck hangs an old key — perhaps to a box of dreams, or maybe to the heart of the one who holds him close.
It seems that if you hug him, all weariness melts away, leaving only sweet calm.

Height: 28 cm (11 in), sitting height 20 cm (7.8 in), width at the widest point 18 cm (7 in).
Made of German plush, filled with cedar wood shavings, cedar wood wool, wool padding, mineral and glass granulate.
Eyes — glass amber eyes (Germany).
The nose is hand-embroidered with thread and waxed.
Lightly shaded with oil paints.
Decoration: a metal alloy key pendant on a leather cord with wooden beads.
