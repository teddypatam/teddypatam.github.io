Let me introduce Sophie, a gentle little vintage-style teddy bear made from hand-dyed antique plush. She is 13 cm tall and entirely handmade with great care and attention to detail.

• Sophie is fully jointed — she has 10 O-shaped cotter pin joints, which make her beautifully poseable.
• Stuffed with cedar shavings and buckwheat hulls.
• Her head is firmly filled, while the body remains soft and pleasant to the touch.
• Thanks to the metal pellets inside, she has a lovely weight to her.
• Her eyes are made of matte glass, giving her a tender, expressive look.
• She wears a crocheted collar.
• Only the crocheted beret is removable — the skirt and collar are not.
• Toned with oil paints and coffee for a warm, vintage patina.

She doesn’t stand on her own, but she absolutely loves to sit and looks adorable doing so.
