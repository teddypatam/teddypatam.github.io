Welcome to Teddy Patam â€” a cozy corner where hand-crafted teddy bears are born with character and care. Each teddy is designed, cut, stitched, and finished by hand, using premium mohair, cotton, and eco-friendly fillings.

Inspired by warm memories and gentle colors, my pieces are unique and made in small batches. I hope they bring comfort and a smile to your day.
